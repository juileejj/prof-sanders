                                    Supply Chain Leaders in Action (SCLA) where we worked together in leadership roles.
                                    Since that time, Nada and I have partnered on numerous industry projects and
                                    presentations.<br/>Nada is one of the most knowledgeable supply chain professionals

                                    have had the good fortune of knowing. She is a master of technical supply chain
                                    topics,
                                    has a focus on lean sigma and continuous improvement, is collaborative in approach
                                    and
                                    is a true visionary in her strategic view of the supply chain industry.<br/>It is

                                    these reasons that I offer my highest of recommendations for Nada as an educator,

                                    University
                                    as the Iacocca Chair in Supply Chain Management. Nada is a forward-thinking
                                    educator,
                                    researcher and consultant who consistently motivates students to excel while
                                    producing
                                    cutting edge research that companies and industry professionals can apply.<br/>I’ve
                                    also
                                    had the opportunity to see her present at various conferences and workshops. While
                                    Nada
                                    is certainly an engaging and inspirational speaker, that isn't what keeps the
                                    participants on the edge of their seats. Rather, it is the acknowledgement that they
                                    are
                                    in the presence of a supply chain visionary who is always thinking outside the box
                                    and
                                    creating innovative supply chain solutions.<br/>One final attribute that I’d like to
                                    point out is trust. Without a doubt, Nada has developed a reputation founded on
                                    trust
                                    that students and industry professionals can rely on. When she says or commits to
                                    something, you can rest assured that it is truthful and that she will deliver based
                                    on
                                    her promise."<br/><span class="pull-right">-Joel Sutherland</span>
